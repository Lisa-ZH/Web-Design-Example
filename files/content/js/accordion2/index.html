		<div class="faq">
			<ul>
				<li class="q">1. Will there be mileage reimbursement for my commute between assigned locations?</li>
				<li class="a">Yes, reimbursement will be provided based on standard labor law.</li>
				<li class="q">2. How often am I required to go to one location versus another?</li>
				<li class="a">You can work a maximum of 50% in 1 location.</li>
				<li class="q">3. Who do I report issues to? What if I no longer want to go to this location or unit?</li>
				<li class="a">Please report issues to the leadership team of central staffing office (CSO). It is not current practice to opt-out of assignments. </li>
				<li class="q">4. When will I get my schedule? In how much advance?</li>
				<li class="a">The great news is that you are able to self-schedule and will know what days you are working in advance since you create your own schedule. </li>
				<li class="q">5. Do all shifts need to be spread out or can I work all shifts in a week or 2-week timeframe out of the 4 weeks? What about on holiday months?</li>
				<li class="a">You can load them in however you like, however, we do not allow more than 5 shifts in a row. You will be required to work one major and one minor holiday, otherwise holiday months do not impact the rest of the scheduling. </li>
				<li class="q">6. How does the self-scheduling work? Is there a minimum amount of time that I need to give if I have to reschedule? What if I need to cancel a shift?</li>
				<li class="a">The schedule opens up 26 days before start and locks 3 days before schedule publication. While self-scheduling is open, you can adjust your days as much as you like. Once the schedule publishes, it is set. Canceling a shift after that is considered a call-off. </li>
