00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:03.120 align:middle line:90%
I love being a nurse, first off.

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.870 align:middle line:84%
And I love the flexibility
of working with the company,

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:10.680 align:middle line:84%
being able to make
my own schedule

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.557 align:middle line:90%
as it benefits my family.

00:00:12.557 --> 00:00:14.640 align:middle line:84%
You get to schedule
everything that you get to do,

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:15.920 align:middle line:90%
how you want to do it.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:17.670 align:middle line:84%
It's like, you have a
list of requirements

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.590 align:middle line:84%
that need to be done in
a month, and you just

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.380 align:middle line:84%
need to schedule your way
around to make them work.

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.930 align:middle line:84%
I'm able to get
off in the morning.

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.060 align:middle line:84%
Some days, I'm there to
take my kids to school,

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.710 align:middle line:84%
but I'm always there
to pick them up.

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.260 align:middle line:84%
If you can only work
these certain days

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.540 align:middle line:84%
or these certain
hours during a week,

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.340 align:middle line:84%
we can find you a
patient who only

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.550 align:middle line:84%
needs a nurse during those
hours and during those days.

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.320 align:middle line:84%
The advantage was the
flexibility for me.

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.500 align:middle line:84%
And I think is still
that for me now,

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.540 align:middle line:90%
just having that flexibility.

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.720 align:middle line:84%
I think that what Aveanna
offers a lot of people,

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.350 align:middle line:84%
that they don't realize, is
the flexibility of scheduling.

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.600 align:middle line:84%
I would definitely recommend
working for Aveanna,

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.650 align:middle line:84%
because that's
what it's given me.

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:06.000 align:middle line:90%
