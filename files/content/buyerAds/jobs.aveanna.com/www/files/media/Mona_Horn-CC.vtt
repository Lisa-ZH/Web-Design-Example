00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:07.470 align:middle line:90%
Hello, my name is Mona Horn.

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.590 align:middle line:84%
I am the therapy director
in Inglewood, Colorado.

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:12.600 align:middle line:90%
I am a speech therapist.

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.090 align:middle line:84%
I specialize in pediatric
feeding therapy.

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:18.600 align:middle line:84%
So my specialty is
teaching babies how to eat.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.620 align:middle line:84%
I think, a lot of times, people
take for granted the ability

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:23.645 align:middle line:90%
to eat food.

00:00:23.645 --> 00:00:25.020 align:middle line:84%
They think every
baby immediately

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:26.770 align:middle line:84%
comes home from the
hospital and they just

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:27.870 align:middle line:90%
want to eat, eat, eat.

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:29.730 align:middle line:84%
Well, unfortunately,
that's not the case

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.369 align:middle line:84%
for a lot of babies that
come home from the hospital,

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.450 align:middle line:84%
but it is my job to figure out
a way that we can teach them

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.780 align:middle line:84%
to eat again, whether it's that
I have to physically teach them

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.080 align:middle line:84%
oral motor wise how to swallow,
how to suck, swallow, breathe.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.260 align:middle line:84%
And it's been very rewarding
taking a baby that comes home

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.170 align:middle line:84%
from the hospital that has a
G-tube, completely dependent

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.040 align:middle line:84%
on their G-tube, and I have
retrained those muscles

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.260 align:middle line:84%
to swallow again, to
teach them to eat again.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.715 align:middle line:84%
You see the eyes of the parents
and the family light up,

00:00:58.715 --> 00:01:00.090 align:middle line:84%
and it's the most
wonderful thing

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.630 align:middle line:90%
that you can provide for them.

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:05.000 align:middle line:90%
