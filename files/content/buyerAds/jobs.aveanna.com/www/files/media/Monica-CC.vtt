My name is Monica Castillo.

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.360 align:middle line:84%
I am an occupational
therapist, and also

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.220 align:middle line:90%
the Therapy Director in Dallas.

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:14.140 align:middle line:84%
I have the clinic
setting that I can

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:16.540 align:middle line:84%
work in which allows
me to collaborate

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:18.370 align:middle line:90%
with the other therapists.

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:21.280 align:middle line:84%
But I also have the
home setting available

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:25.810 align:middle line:84%
to me, as well, which allows me
to really work with the family

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:27.610 align:middle line:90%
in their home setting.

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:31.650 align:middle line:84%
It's-- it's
indescribable really.

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.040 align:middle line:84%
For me, I know I have
the skill set to effect

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.170 align:middle line:90%
change in that patient's life.

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.730 align:middle line:84%
But then also to see the
parents and the caregivers so

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.600 align:middle line:90%
appreciative of something that--

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:45.690 align:middle line:90%
a skill that I have.

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.327 align:middle line:84%
And that I've been able
to make that change.

00:00:48.327 --> 00:00:50.160 align:middle line:84%
It's really-- it's a
privilege and an honor.
