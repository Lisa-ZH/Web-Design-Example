[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:05.510 align:middle line:84%
I started five years ago
and I've never looked back.

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:08.710 align:middle line:84%
I feel like I'm part of
their family and I love that.

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:11.050 align:middle line:84%
I can't imagine doing
anything else at this point.

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:14.380 align:middle line:84%
I've been doing this
for over 10 years

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:16.950 align:middle line:84%
and I really have started
from the ground up.

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:20.140 align:middle line:84%
And I love to be able to
see the successes that I

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:22.630 align:middle line:84%
see in the individuals
that we serve.

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.330 align:middle line:84%
I've been in health care for
over 20 years, and the ability

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:29.620 align:middle line:84%
to affect change within
a fragile population

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:32.770 align:middle line:84%
and be able to work with
amazing people every day,

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:34.480 align:middle line:90%
to help families in need--

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.350 align:middle line:84%
it is really the
reason I'm here.

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.690 align:middle line:84%
I love that my job is
different every day.

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.770 align:middle line:84%
We get to work with
little kids, older kids.

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:47.530 align:middle line:84%
But if you want to work for
a place, work in a place

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.170 align:middle line:84%
and work for an
organization that's

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.740 align:middle line:84%
committed to touching hearts,
you want to work at Aveanna.

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:57.430 align:middle line:84%
We're the front line
and the first people

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:59.110 align:middle line:90%
that moms and dads speak with.

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:02.470 align:middle line:84%
And we're creating something
that no one's ever done before.

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:06.130 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of the day,
it's nice being in a big group

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.310 align:middle line:84%
where everybody treats
each other like family.

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:10.960 align:middle line:90%
That's what it's all about.

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.430 align:middle line:84%
We have about 30,000 caregivers
at this point and caring

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.120 align:middle line:84%
for about 15,000,
16,000 patients.

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:20.890 align:middle line:84%
And that number is
only going to grow.

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.560 align:middle line:84%
We have so much talent
within our therapy department

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:25.870 align:middle line:90%
and our therapy team.

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:28.930 align:middle line:84%
I'm excited about being
part of the bigger picture.

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:31.060 align:middle line:84%
Health care is changing
and health care

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:32.590 align:middle line:90%
continues to change.

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.990 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things that
I notice is that Aveanna.

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.720 align:middle line:84%
Is very progressive and
proactive about the changes

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.190 align:middle line:84%
that are happening
in health care.

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:44.980 align:middle line:84%
We're excited to meet
those challenges of growth

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.650 align:middle line:90%
and revolution and change.

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:49.600 align:middle line:90%
We embrace change.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.130 align:middle line:84%
There's nowhere else I want to
be right now than where I am.

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.202 align:middle line:90%
